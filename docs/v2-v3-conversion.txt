KUBACKUP-SERVER - CONVERSION FROM V2 TO V3
==========================================

in version 3 the format of config files is changed, I have dropped
the ugly one-file-one-var format to adopt a classic format

each system has now a single config file, named <sys>.conf

the file is a shell snippet, the variables are defined almost
verbatim from the single files of v2, ie:

	uuid='65a09afb-9620-4304-95e6-c052e33a3a5b'
	address='myserver'
	allow='10.10.0.250'
	groups='local srv'
	rotations='3'
	#slot=
	#precedence=

the .conf files will not be included as-is in the other scripts, but
read by a single command, kubackup-getconf, that will take care of
sanity checks, settings defaults, and so on


CONVERSION
----------
in the doc directory there is the conversion script, called
convert-to-v3.sh

you need to run this script in each kubackup-server directory, starting
from the default one (/etc/kubackup) and any other you may optionally have
configured

the script reads the <sys>_* files and write down a single <sys>.conf file,
the old format files will be removed; only a couple of files will be left
untouched:

	<sys>_modules	because have it's own format and cannot be
			easily translate in a single variabale defition

	<sys>_disabled	because is a flag file, and is convenient to left
			it as-is

before converting the script will make a backup of the whole directory
